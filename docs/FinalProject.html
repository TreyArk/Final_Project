    <h3>Abstract: This collection brings together all the maps created in Geography 4770: Advanced Topics in Geoinformatics. A variety of methods and services were used to make the maps. The data came in multiple formats, such as KML and GeoJSON, and was sourced from different web servers including USGS and ArcGIS. Various map elements were also added, such as legends, swipe tools, queries, and more.</h3>
